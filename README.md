### Docker

All environment isolated from host system via Docker containers.

For understanding of how Docker works please read this articles:

 - [About Docker](http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/paulballard/what-developers-need-to-know-about-docker)
 - [Visualizing Docker Containers and Images](http://merrigrove.blogspot.com.by/2015/10/visualizing-docker-containers-and-images.html)
 - [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/misc/)
 - [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Shortcuts

To simplify your life, you can use shortcuts available in `docker/shortcuts` shell script. To make it even more easy to use, just add path to this directory in your `PATH` env variable (in `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):

```
export PATH=./docker/shortcuts:$PATH
```

By doing this, you will be able to use short versions of commands:

```bash
apidoc                      # run command to generate api doc from raml file
php                         # run command in php container
console                     # symfony console running via docker container
psql                        # connects psql to your database using containers
composer                    # shortcut for running composer (with php7 in separate docker container)
php_stan                    # shortcut for running PHPstan (Static Analysis Tool)
```

## Development

To start dev environment, just run `docker-compose up` and you are ready to go.

## API Documentation

In order to modify the documentation, you need to make changes to the `app/resources/docs/api.raml` file and regenerate the documentation using `apidoc` bash script.

You can see the documentation for api by `${TARGET_HOST}/api.html`.


### Testing

To run test suites you can use `docker/shortcuts/run_tests` script

Usage:  test [suite] [option]

Examples:
   - run_tests                 - starts all tests suites
   - run_tests unit            - starts unit test suite
   - run_tests u - you may run suite for part of tests

### XDebug

This projects template also includes xdebug extensions for remote debugging. To debug your application in PhpStorm you should configure remote server and [set path mapping](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/help/override-server-path-mappings-dialog.html) to `/app` directory.

In production environment xdebug is disabled.
